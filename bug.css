The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, if there are spaces around the operators (+, -, *, /), the calculation might fail. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works correctly, while `width: calc( 100% - 20px );` might not work as expected.  Another issue arises from unit mismatches. You must use consistent units throughout the calculation; mixing units without proper conversion will cause unexpected results. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20em)` will not cause an error, but the result will be unexpected.
