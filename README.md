This repository demonstrates two uncommon errors that can occur when using the `calc()` function in CSS.  The first error involves spaces around the operators within the `calc()` function, while the second involves unit mismatches. The `bug.css` file shows the code with these errors, and `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected code.

The `calc()` function is a powerful tool, but it's important to follow these best practices to avoid unexpected issues: 

*   Avoid spaces around operators (+, -, *, /) within the `calc()` function. 
*   Maintain consistent units across the calculation.
